        <p>
          Incoming Data Science Master’s student at Harvard SEAS with a background in Math, Physics, and CS from the
          University of Michigan. I’m interested in the connections between physics and AI/ML, especially through the
          lens of emergent complexity, and in applying these ideas to build safer, more interpretable AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Michigan, I was a Data Science Fellow at the <a href="https://ai.umich.edu">Center for Academic
            Innovation</a>, where I developed ExploreBlue, a course recommendation system using LLMs and semantic search
          under the guidance of <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/evrard.html">Prof. August
            Evrard</a> and <a href="https://ai.umich.edu/staff/mark-mills/">Dr. Mark Mills</a>. I also served as a peer
          advisor for the Physics Department.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I worked as an AI/ML Engineering Intern at <a
            href="https://www.honeywell.com/us/en">Honeywell</a>, where I worked on AI and classical image processing
          techniques to automatically extract building layouts from floor plans and generate cost estimates for
          corporate facility projects. I also built a vibration analysis system that autonomously diagnoses equipment
          faults by combining signal processing with LLM reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I was an ML Research Intern at <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/mtri/">Michigan Tech Research
            Institute</a>, where I worked on ML methods for accelerating inverse problem solving in imaging with the
          goal of real-time super resolution under the guidance of <a
            href="https://www.mtu.edu/mtri/about/staff/directors-management/leblanc/">Dr. Joel LeBlanc</a>, and at <a
            href="https://www.neurabuild.com">Neurabuild</a> in South Africa, where I developed ML solutions for
          astronomical site assessment and satellite tracking for the <a
            href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns/research_projects/current_projects/astrosite">Astrosite</a>
          project under the guidance of <a
            href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns/about/people/researchers/gregory_cohen">Prof. Gregory Cohen</a>.

          <p>
            We introduce a novel course recommendation system that combines large language models with semantic search to bridge natural language queries and course descriptions. Our two-stage approach generates idealized course descriptions from student interests, then uses embedding similarity to identify relevant courses. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the system's ability to provide contextually appropriate recommendations with explanatory rationales.
