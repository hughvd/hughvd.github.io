        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Master's student at Harvard studying Data Science with a background in Math, Physics, and Computer Science from the University of Michigan. My research interests in AI are focused on interpretability, safety, and the science of deep learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Harvard, I am currently working on masked diffusion models. I'm also a Spring 2026 <a href="https://www.cbai.ai/fellowship">CBAI Research Fellow</a>, working with <a href="https://lauraruis.github.io">Dr. Laura Ruis</a> on chain-of-thought (COT) monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Michigan, I was a Data Science Fellow at the <a href="https://ai.umich.edu">Center for Academic Innovation</a>, where I developed ExploreBlue, a course recommendation system using LLMs and semantic search under the guidance of <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/evrard.html">Prof. August Evrard</a> and <a href="https://ai.umich.edu/staff/mark-mills/">Dr. Mark Mills</a>. I also served as a peer advisor for the Physics Department.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I worked as an AI/ML Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/us/en">Honeywell</a>, where I worked on AI and classical image processing techniques to automatically extract building layouts from floor plans and generate cost estimates for
          corporate facility projects. Previously, I was an ML Research Intern at <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/mtri/">Michigan Tech Research Institute</a>, where I worked on ML methods for accelerating inverse problem solvers under the guidance of <a
          href="https://www.mtu.edu/mtri/about/staff/directors-management/leblanc/">Dr. Joel LeBlanc</a>, and at <a href="https://www.neurabuild.com">Neurabuild</a> in South Africa, where I developed ML solutions for astronomical site assessment and satellite tracking for the <a
          href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns/research_projects/current_projects/astrosite">Astrosite</a> project under the guidance of <a
          href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns/about/people/researchers/gregory_cohen">Prof. Gregory Cohen</a>.

              <p>
                We introduce a novel course recommendation system that combines large language models with semantic search to bridge natural language queries and course descriptions. Our two-stage approach generates idealized course descriptions from student interests, then uses embedding similarity to identify relevant courses. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the system's ability to provide contextually appropriate recommendations with explanatory rationales.
